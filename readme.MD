# 🛒 **Marketplace Application**

Welcome to the **Marketplace Application** repository, a modern platform designed to connect stores and businesses with their customers. This project is built with **Spring Boot** for a robust and scalable backend, **JWT** with **Spring Security** for secure authentication, and **MongoDB** for efficient database management.

---

## 🚀 **Technologies Used**

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building robust, secure, and maintainable Java applications.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Implemented using **Spring Security** to provide stateless and secure authentication.
- **MongoDB**: Scalable and flexible NoSQL database.
- **Maven**: Project management and dependency handling tool.

## 📁 **Project Structure**

The project follows a **domain-oriented architecture** to ensure scalability and maintain code clarity. 

## 🔐 **Authentication and Security**

The application uses **JWT** in conjunction with **Spring Security** to manage secure, stateless user authentication. Every authenticated request requires a valid JWT token, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive resources.

## 🗄️ **Database**

The application utilizes **MongoDB** as the database, offering flexible and scalable data storage. MongoDB integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot through **Spring Data MongoDB**.
